              By indicating your acceptance to purchase any product or service
              offered on the site, the user is obligated to complete such

              confirmed and/or payment levied. If the payment has been
              processed, the same shall be credited to your account and duly

              In a credit card transaction, you must use your own credit card.
              Spaceframe will not be liable for any credit card fraud. The

              Payment gateway takes 24-48 hours to confirm the payment and check
              for fraudulent transactions. Shipment/delivery time of order
              processing starts from the day of receipt of the payment confirmed
              against the order placed with Spaceframe. Usually, all orders are
              processed and shipped within 7 working days, once payment is
              confirmed. However, certain categories of products have different
              lead times for delivery due to the nature of the product.
              Spaceframe shall not be liable for any delay/non-delivery of
              purchased goods in events such as floods, fires, wars, acts of
